## Finance and Supply Chain Analysis using MySQL ðŸ’¼


### Description:
Step into the world of the MySQL project! Some cool tools like JOIN, SubQueries, CTEs, and Window Functions to work with the data. These tools helped turn raw data into useful information. I also made things easier to read and faster to run by using queries, views, and stored procedures.

Now, let's talk about Finance stuff! ðŸ’° We used dates to make Fiscal years that fit AtliQ Hardware's needs. Then, we looked at different tables to find important things like Customers,Markets, and how much stuff was sold. We put it all together to figure out things like who are the top and bottom 5 Customer,products, and markets.

And for supply chain stuff, we used Temporary tables and CTEs to look at things like Net error and Forecast accuracy. This helps us make sure everything runs smoothly.

My Task? To help AtliQ Hardware make smart decisions and do well. With clean, easy-to-read info, the sky's the limit! Let's dive in and make it happen! ðŸš€
